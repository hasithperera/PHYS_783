# PHYS 783 - Final project

Use VP code available [here](https://homepage.physics.uiowa.edu/~ghowes/teach/phys5905/codes5905.html) to study inverse Landau damping.

- [x] Run the basic code to see landau damping
- [x] Read data files and generate plots
- [x] Implement bump in tail. Initial condition. (fluid eq)
- [x] Access f(t) at known time steps


## Progress as of 2/05/2024

- Landau Damping was observed
- Using multiple species was not as effective
- Implemented a bump on the tail externally at init
- Final presentation can be found [here](./doc/Inverse%20landau%20damping%20using%20VP.pdf)
