# PHYS 783 - Final project

Use VP code available [here](https://homepage.physics.uiowa.edu/~ghowes/teach/phys5905/codes5905.html) to study inverse Landau damping.

- [ ] Run the basic code to see landau damping
- [ ] Read data files and generate plots
- [ ] Implement bump in tail. Initial condition. (fluid eq)
- [ ] Access f(t) at known time steps
